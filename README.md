# SMCNOD
This study on SMCNOD utilizes statistical data analysis methods including Bayesian modeling, Gaussian Mixture Models and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to determine kinematics, metallicity and proper motions of the stellar overdensity. The results indicate that the constraints derived are promising. The code and analysis for this study is available here. The content of this repository may be updated to be more complete.
