# SMCNOD
This study on SMCNOD utilizes statistical data analysis methods including Bayesian modeling, Gaussian Mixture Models and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to determine kinematics, metallicity and proper motions of the stellar overdensity. The results indicate that the constraints derived are promising. The code and analysis for this study is available here. The content of this repository may be updated to be more complete.

The folder `PM_compare` would include my up-to-date analysis on adding the proper motions to our model for SMCNOD, how it differs from a model without proper motions, a model with pmra and pmdec modeled as 1-D respectively, and a model with 2-D proper motions considering covariance matrix.
